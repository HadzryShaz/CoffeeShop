Pro-Tip: The Actual Path
If you are trying to find this folder on Windows to actually move the database, the path usually looks like this: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\NetBeans\derby

Note: The AppData folder is hidden by default. To see it, you may need to click View in your File Explorer and check the Hidden items box.
